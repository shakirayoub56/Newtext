PROPS:
The Data is passed from one component to another.
It is Immutable (cannot be modified).
Props can be used with state and functional components.
Props are read-only.

STATE:
The Data is passed within the component only.
It is Mutable ( can be modified).
State can be used only with the state components/class component (Before 16.0).
State is both read and write.


USESTATE:
It declares a “state variable…This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls —useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.

Map
The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.

Filter
The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.

Reduce
The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. To get the output value, it runs a reducer function on each element of the array.
